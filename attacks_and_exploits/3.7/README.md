## Lateral movement
### RPC/DCOM - Remote Procedure Call/Distributed Component Object Model
* PsExec - PowerShell
* WMI - Managing devices and applications from remote computers
* Scheduled tasks
### PS remoting/WinRM
* SMB - Server Message Block for sharing folders, drives, ect
* RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol for Windows
* Apple Remote Desktop - Remote Desktop for Apple devices
* VNC - Virtual Network Computing
* X-server forwarding - X-windows access for Linux desktop, like RDP for Linux
* Telnet - Unencrypted CLI access
* SSH - Encrypted CLI access
* RSH/Rlogin - Legacy security remote access
## Persistence
* Scheduled jobs & Scheduled tasks - Cron or Task Manager which allows things to be scheduled in the future.
* Daemons - Background Processes & Services, such as listeners. Commands typically have a 'D' at the end, such as FTPD
* Back doors - Bypassess common security controls, such as a malicious daemon.
* Trojan - Malware which appears to do something useful or desireable.
* New user creation - Makes coming back later much easier if theres a new account created with credentials only the attacker knows.
## Covering your tracks
Files & tools should be erased. Files which need to be left, should be well hidden. Log files should be sanitized. Any other traces should be removed.

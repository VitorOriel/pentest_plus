# 3.3 Given a scenario, exploit wireless and RF-based vulnerabilities.
## Evil twin
Impersonating a named network in order to fool users into logging into it.
* Karma attack (Karma Attacks Radio Machines Automatically) - Listens to SSID requests and sets up a WAP based on that
* Downgrade attack - Attempts to negotiate a more insescure protocol.
## Deauthentication attacks
DoS attacks which disrupt communication between users and WAPs in an effort to force users to reauthenticate, where there credentials may be captured.
## Fragmentation attacks
Floods a network with datagram fragments, the receiving end attempts to reassemble them but cannot. The recieving end uses its resources and is effectively DoS'd.
## Credential harvesting
Capturing login credentils. May be done via social engineering, or in the case of a wireless scenerio, setting up a fake log in page.
## WPS implementation weakness
Some routers have a feature enabled called WPS which allows users nearby the router to authenticate by simply pressing a button. This process is often vulnerable to different attacks such as brute forcing the access pin.
## Bluejacking
Sending unsolicited messages to a BT enabled device.
## Bluesnarfing
Stealing BT data from nearby devices.
## RFID cloning
Copying RFID enabled cards.
## Jamming
DoS attack which disables communication among devices.
## Repeating
Retransmitting a signal in order to increase the signals range.

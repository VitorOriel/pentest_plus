# 3.2 Given a scenario, exploit network-based vulnerabilities.
## Name resolution exploits
* NETBIOS name service - similar to DNS, except for the local network.
* LLMNR - IPV4 & IPV6 bridge for DNS.
# SMB exploits - Protocol which provides remote file and priter access.
# SNMP exploits - Protocol used to manage IP devices.
# SMTP exploits - Mail protocol.
# FTP exploits - File transfer protocol.
# DNS cache poisoning - Changing the IP in a compromised DNS server so that clients will connect to the attackers system.
# Pass the hash - Attacker intercepts an NTLM hash and reuses it to appear as an authenticated user to Windows.
# Man-in-the-middle
* ARP spoofing - Local spoofing of MAC addresses.
* Replay - Attacker grabs packets and resends them to a destination server.
* Relay - Intercepted traffic is rerouted.
* SSL stripping - Decrypting of encrypted traffic
* Downgrade - Proxy uses the lowest agreeable level of encryption, possibly even turning it off.
# DoS/stress test - Degrading a service
# NAC bypass - Finding an alternate route passed controls
# VLAN hopping

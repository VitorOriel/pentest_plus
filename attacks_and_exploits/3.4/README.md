# 3.4 Given a scenario, exploit application-based vulnerabilities.
## Injections
Inserting additional data into an application beyond what was expected
* SQL - Crafted SQL input which returns or modifies data beyond what was intended. May also execute commands in some cases.
* HTML - Potential to change the page itself, perhaps in an attempt to deface or trick other users.   
* Command - adding additional options that may change the way the commands operate.
* Code - general term for adding additional code that changes the original intended function.
Tools: sqlmap
## Authentication
* Credential brute forcing - forcefully attempting to guess or crack credentials.
* Session hijacking - intercepting and using a session token to impersonate a logged in user.
* Redirect - Sending a user to a different site than they expeceted (phishing) 
* Default credentials - A common mistake of leaving the default credentials for systems in production
* Weak credentials - Suseptible to brute force.
* Kerberos exploits - Forged tickets may allow unauthorized access to resources.
## Authorization
* Parameter pollution - providing custom input parameters to alter services or API's.
* Insecure direct object reference - Programming mistake that can allow an attacker to bypass security controls and access resources and data.
## Cross-site scripting (XSS)
Injection attack which the attacker sends code that the server unintetnionally runs.
* Stored/persistent - Attacker sends code which is then stored on the site, such as in a database that can be retrieved by other users.
* Reflected - non-persistant code which is not sent to another client.
* DOM - Attack uses XML, not HTML, to transport attack code.
## Cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF)
Occurs within an authenticated session. XSRF attackers the user, not the server. Attacker can cause authrized users to take an action, such as changing their password.
## Clickjacking
Tricking a user to click a different link or object than what they intended. Often uses transparent or opaque layers.
## Security misconfiguration
* Directory traversal - allows users to navigate outside of the webservers root directory.
* Cookie manipulation - may be able to change how the application behaves based on cookie contents.
## File inclusion
Attacker is able to build a path to an executable file and ran on the server.
* Local - path to file is local on the servers system.
* Remote - path to the file is remote on the attackers system.
## Unsecure code practices
* Comments in source code - great source of unfinished or unimplemented functions.
* Lack of error handling - errors that aren't handled may give an attacker a way to crash the app or inject code.
* Overly verbose error handling - may provide too many details which can give cludes to potential vulnerabilities.
* Hard-coded credentials - easily forgotten from development phase.
* Race conditions - resource shouild be validated before it's used.
* Unauthorized use of functions/unprotected APIs - unintended API usage
* Hidden elements - easily discovered by a curious attacker.
* Sensitive information in the DOM - Easily discovered by inspecting the page.
* Lack of code signing - code may be recompiled by an attacker with malicious code.

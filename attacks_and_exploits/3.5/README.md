# 3.5 Given a scenario, exploit local host vulnerabilities.
## OS vulnerabilities
Use CVE databases to find publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
* Windows
* Mac OS
* Linux
* Android
* iOS
## Unsecure service and protocol configurations
## Privilege escalation
### Linux-specific
* SUID/SGID programs (Set User ID, Set Group ID) - Crashing out of a program that runs as an elevated user may give an elevated prompt
* Unsecure SUDO - Authorized users execute commands as if root
* Ret2libc - stack overflow attack. Replaces current stack return address with attacker-chosen address of another subroutine. Libc includes useful calls, such as 'system'.
* Sticky bits - Directory permission which sets a permission that allows multiple users to create, read, and write files but only the owner can delete.
### Windows-specific
* Cpassword
* Clear text credentials in LDAP
* Kerberoasting
* Credentials in LSASS
* Unattended installation
* SAM database
* DLL hijacking
* Exploitable services
* Unquoted service paths
* Writable services
* Unsecure file/folder permissions
* Keylogger
* Scheduled tasks
* Kernel exploits
## Default account settings
## Sandbox escape
* Shell upgrade
* VM
* Container
## Physical device security
* Cold boot attack
* JTAG debug
* Serial console

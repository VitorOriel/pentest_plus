# 3.5 Given a scenario, exploit local host vulnerabilities.
## OS vulnerabilities
Use CVE databases to find publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
* Windows
* Mac OS
* Linux
* Android
* iOS
## Unsecure service and protocol configurations
## Privilege escalation
### Linux-specific
* SUID/SGID programs (Set User ID, Set Group ID) - Crashing out of a program that runs as an elevated user may give an elevated prompt
* Unsecure SUDO - Authorized users execute commands as if root
* Ret2libc - stack overflow attack. Replaces current stack return address with attacker-chosen address of another subroutine. Libc includes useful calls, such as 'system'.
* Sticky bits - Directory permission which sets a permission that allows multiple users to create, read, and write files & executables but only the owner can delete them.
### Windows-specific
* Cpassword - Group policy preference attribute that contains passwords. SYSVOL folder of the domain controller (encrypted XML)
* Clear text credentials in LDAP
* Kerberoasting - Domain users that can query Kerberos tickets for other users.
* Credentials in LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) - Enforces security policy 
* Unattended installation - PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) may contain credentials
* SAM database (Security Account Manager) - Database that contains user passwords
* DLL hijacking (Dynamic Link Library) - Forcing a loader to load a malicious DLL 
### Exploitable services
* Unquoted service paths - Allows abbreviated attack paths without spaces. IE "C:\Program Files" vs C:\Program\Files
* Writable services - The ability to write and change the path to the service
* Unsecure file/folder permissions - Allowing read/write by non root users
* Keylogger - records every keystroke.
* Scheduled tasks - Attacker may add tasks which run with elevated privlidges.
* Kernel exploits
## Default account settings
Defaults should be disabled or renamed. Default passwords should always be changed.
## Sandbox escape
* Shell upgrade - gaining access to a shell on the host system, with root privliges.
* VM - Virtual Machine
* Container
## Physical device security
* Cold boot attack - Rebooting a system and launching a different OS may allow access to things such as encryption keys or password databases.
* JTAG debug - (Joint Test Action Group) - Allows for attackers to debug hardware. Industry standard for debugging circuit boards.
* Serial console - Direct access to servers and network gear.

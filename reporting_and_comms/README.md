# 5.0 Reporting and Communication
## 5.1 Given a scenario, use report writing and handling best practices.
* Normalization of data
* Written report of findings and remediation
  * Executive summary
  * Methodology
  * Findings and remediation
  * Metrics and measures
  * Risk rating
  * Conclusion
* Risk appetite
* Storage time for report
* Secure handling and disposition of reports

## 5.2 Explain post-report delivery activities.
* Post-engagement cleanup
  * Removing shells
  * Removing tester-created credentials
  * Removing tools
* Client acceptance
* Lessons learned
* Follow-up actions/retest
* Attestation of findings

## 5.3 Given a scenario, recommend mitigation strategies for discovered vulnerabilities.
* Solutions
  * People
  * Process
  * Technology
* Findings
  * Shared local administrator credentials
  * Weak password complexity
  * Plain text passwords
  * No multifactor authentication
  * SQL injection
  * Unnecessary open services
* Remediation
  * Randomize credentials/LAPS
  * Minimum password requirements/password filters
  * Encrypt the passwords
  * Implement multifactor authentication
  * Sanitize user input/parameterize queries
  * System hardening

## 5.4 Explain the importance of communication during the penetration testing process.
* Communication path
* Communication triggers
  * Critical findings
  * Stages
  * Indicators of prior compromise
* Reasons for communication
  * Situational awareness
  * De-escalation
  * De-confliction
* Goal reprioritization

# 5.3 Given a scenario, recommend mitigation strategies for discovered vulnerabilities.
## Solutions
* People - behavior changes, passwords
* Process - policy, IDM
* Technology - HW/SW Controls
## Findings
* Shared local administrator credentials
* Weak password complexity
* Plain text passwords
* No multifactor authentication
* SQL injection
* Unnecessary open services
## Remediation
* Randomize credentials/LAPS
* Minimum password requirements/password filters
* Encrypt the passwords
* Implement multifactor authentication
* Sanitize user input/parameterize queries
* System hardening

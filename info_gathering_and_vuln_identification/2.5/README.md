## 2.5 Explain weakness related to specialized systems.
# ICS
Industrial Control Systems
* Environmental conditions
* Exposure to real world (live) events
# SCADA
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

Control system which manages interfaces with ICS's. 

* Often sold as turnkey software. Embedded software and OS's which are rarely updated.
* Often difficult to update

# Mobile
* Lack of updates, compromised settings, dangerious apps, ect...

# IoT
Internet of Things

* Weak security
* Often open to the Internet
* Rarely updated

# Embedded
* Eaze of access/use main selling point
* Similar to IoT

# Point-of-sale system
* Attractive to attackers due to proximity to payment 
* Similar security concerns to IoT devices.

# Biometrics
* Accuracy is still evolving
* High failure rate - fallback is often to skip the check all together
* Can often be fooled

# Application containers
* Containers are not foolproof
* If the container can compromise the host system, several other applications may be exploited

# RTOS
Real Time Operating System
* Designed to provide fast, lightweight services, not security

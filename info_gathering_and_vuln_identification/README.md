# 2.0 Information Gathering and Vulnerability Identification
## 2.1 Given a scenario, conduct information gathering using appropriate techniques.
* Scanning
* Enumeration
  * Hosts
  * Networks
  * Domains
  * Users
  * Groups
  * Network shares
  * Web pages
  * Applications
  * Services
  * Tokens
  * Social networking sites
* Packet crafting
* Packet inspection
* Fingerprinting
* Cryptography
  * Certificate inspection
* Eavesdropping
  * RF communication monitoring
  * Sniffing
  * Wired
  * Wireless
* Decompilation
* Debugging
* Open Source Intelligence Gathering
  * Sources of research
  * CERT
  * NIST
  * JPCERT
  * CAPEC
  * Full disclosure
  * CVE
  * CWE
  
## 2.2 Given a scenario, perform a vulnerability scan.
* Credentialed vs. non-credentialed
* Types of scans
  * Discovery scan
  * Full scan
  * Stealth scan
  * Compliance scan
* Container security
* Application scan
  * Dynamic vs. static analysis
* Considerations of vulnerability scanning
  * Time to run scans
  * Protocols used
  * Network topology
  * Bandwidth limitations
  * Query throttling
  * Fragile systems/non-traditional assets

## 2.3 Given a scenario, analyze vulnerability scan results.
* Asset categorization
* Adjudication
  * False positives
* Prioritization of vulnerabilities
* Common themes
  * Vulnerabilities
  * Observations
  * Lack of best practices
  
## 2.4 Explain the process of leveraging information to prepare for exploitation.
* Map vulnerabilities to potential exploits
* Prioritize activities in preparation for penetration test
* Describe common techniques to complete attack
  * Cross-compiling code
  * Exploit modification
  * Exploit chaining
  * Proof-of-concept development (exploit development)
  * Social engineering
  * Credential brute forcing
  * Dictionary attacks
  * Rainbow tables
  * Deception
  
## 2.5 Explain weakness related to specialized systems.
* ICS
* SCADA
* Mobile
* IoT
* Embedded
* Point-of-sale system
* Biometrics
* Application containers
* RTOS

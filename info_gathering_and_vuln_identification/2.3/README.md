# 2.3 Given a scenario, analyze vulnerability scan results.
## Asset categorization
Assets may be categorized by type and importance. A web server sitting in a DMZ may be a lesser desirable target than one sitting within the network.
## Adjudication
False positives are rare, but happen. This is when a vulnerability scanner believes a target may be vulnerable but isn't.
## Prioritization of vulnerabilities
You should take some time and prioritize your list of assets and the vulnerabilities discovered on them in order to make your efforts most effective.
## Common themes
* Vulnerabilities
* Observations
* Lack of best practices

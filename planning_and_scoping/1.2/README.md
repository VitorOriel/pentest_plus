# 1.2 Explain key legal concepts.
## Contracts

### SOW
The Statement Of Work outlines the specifics of the work to be completed. It may include things such as:
* Purpose
* Scope
* Deliverables
* Schedules
* Acceptance Criteria
* Location
* and others

### MSA
The Master Service Agreement is the overarching contract between the two parties which will cover such conditions as:
* Payment
* Timeframe
* Warranties
* Dispute Resolution
* and others

### NDA
The Non-Disclosure Agreement is an agreement between the pentestee and the pentester which protects the pentestee in the event a compromise occurs. It will outline what can, or cannot be disclosed to 3rd parties.

## Environmental differences
Ensure you read up and follow any export restrictions if conducting business outside your home country. Local and national government restrictions may play a factor as well, and it is up to the pentester to be aware of them.

## Corporate policies
  Written authorization is required before beginning a pentest. These signatures should be from an individual who is authorized to do so. In some cases, such as when testing assets in a cloud, you may need to obtain additional authorization from 3rd party providers.
